# Agent Rules

## Scope

- Work only inside the current repository unless the user explicitly directs otherwise.
- Read relevant files and project instructions before editing.
- Keep changes minimal, verify them with relevant tests, and report concrete results.

## Boundaries

- Do not read or print secrets: `.env`, `auth.json`, `*.pem`, SSH keys, browser cookies, credential stores.
- Do not delete or move user data unless explicitly instructed.
- Do not run destructive git commands (`reset --hard`, `clean -fd`) without explicit user approval.
- Keep generated artifacts out of git unless they are intentional deliverables.
- Keep task temporary files, caches, logs, test environments and generated review artifacts in the current Git project's ignored `.hermes/task-runtime/` or `.hermes/task-artifacts/`; never spill them into `%TEMP%`, the user home, desktop, Hermes Home, or another project.
- Hermes' terminal pre-tool hook rejects raw terminal commands. Every terminal call must declare the current Git project as `workdir` and invoke `python "$HERMES_HOME/bin/hermes-project-data.py" --project . <subcommand>`; shell chaining is prohibited.
- Before a command that can create runtime data, run `python "$HERMES_HOME/bin/hermes-project-data.py" --project . check`; run the command through `... run -- <command>` so standard temp/cache variables are project-local. Reject explicit output/cache/log paths outside the project root.
- After a successful task, preserve durable evidence in `.hermes/task-artifacts/`, then run `python "$HERMES_HOME/bin/hermes-project-data.py" --project . cleanup`. Failed tasks retain project-local evidence until reviewed.

## Quality Bar

A task is not done until the requested artifact exists and has been exercised by a real command or inspection.
